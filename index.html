        <h2> What are activities, hobbies and interests? </h2>
        <p>
          A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time.
          Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports,
          or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and
          knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making
          it diverse and lengthy.

        <p>
          <p>
            Science is the best way to understand the universe, and as a curius person, I am a huge science enthusiast. I have been a curius person right from a tender age.
            I just had something inside me that just wanted to understand or at least have an abstract knowledge of the universe. But the main thing that triggered that
            curiousity was when I learned about the moon landing, I got so inspired and was seeking knowledge on how the astronauts were able to land on the moon.
            So I read a lot of articles and that led me to the thirst of more knowledge. There's so much more information about this so I made a whole page for it, 
            you can click on the title that would take you to the next page.

        <p>
          <P>
            The beautiful game of basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world, it is widely played almost everywhere in the world, it features superstars like
            the greatest basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kareem AbdulJabbar and many more great players.

          </P>
          <P>
          I have been playing this beautiful game since I was 6 years of age, I started playing the game with my cousins at my
          grandmother's house, there's an empty space inside the house which is a bit far from the main building, so my cousins
          installed a hoop there and we play the sport there, it is always amazing to play with them.

        <h2> Gaming </h2>
        <p>
          <p>
            A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device
            such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device â€“ to generate visual feedback. This feedback is
            shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are
            often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback,
            including haptic technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been playing games for a long time and it don't look like I am stopping anytime soon, they are relaxing and they somehow
            improve some reflexes and focus as some studies suggest. My favorite games to play are FIFA, NBA, Call of duty and Need for speed.
            I prefer playing in consoles over gaming PCs, as I feel like I have more control when using a controller than a keyboard. My favorite
            console so far is the PS4 as I haven't played the PS5 enough to judge, I also prefer the playstation over the xbox, just my own preference
            not the same as everyone else, but most people would go for the playstation over the xbox too.
